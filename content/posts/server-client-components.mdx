- **Get out of bed and out of pajamas.** The simple act of getting up is a good first victory of the day. Leave a few sticky notes with positive affirmations where you can see them, such as: “Yes, you can do it,” “Every long journey starts with one step,” or “Never give up!” Your brain digests whatever thoughts you create, so feed it positive ones¹.
- **Go for a walk.** Exercise helps your body release endorphins, the feel-good hormones. Exercising for at least 35 minutes a day, five days a week, can improve symptoms of mild to moderate depression. It may also help treat more severe forms of depression¹. Walking outside can also expose you to natural sunlight, which can boost your mood and regulate your circadian rhythm.
- **Get your hands dirty to get a mood lift.** According to a study with mice, a certain type of bacteria found in dirt (Mycobacterium vaccae) may enhance the production of serotonin. Serotonin in turn helps decrease the symptoms of depression¹. Bacteria found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, can also enhance moods by reducing anxiety and potentially improving symptoms of depression¹. So try gardening, cooking, or doing some crafts to get in touch with nature and your creativity.
- **Don’t overschedule.** Congratulate yourself for every task or goal you complete, no matter how small. If you can only accomplish one or two tasks, that’s fine. Congratulate yourself for every task or goal you complete, no matter how small. That will help improve your confidence and sense of motivation¹. Avoid taking on too many responsibilities or commitments that can overwhelm you and make you feel stressed or guilty. Learn to say no to things that are not essential or enjoyable for you.
- **Avoid negativity.** Reading the news or surfing the internet, talking to people who leave you feeling drained and negative, or revisiting sad topics —these activities can all have an impact on your mood and motivation¹. Instead, focus on feelings of gratitude. Write down three things that you are grateful for every day, or express your appreciation to someone who has helped you or made you happy. Gratitude can help you shift your perspective from what’s wrong to what’s right in your life.
- **Stick to a routine.** Creating a sustainable routine is also helpful. When feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your goals into manageable chunks¹. Plan your day ahead and prioritize the most important or urgent tasks. Follow a regular schedule for sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing. Having a sense of structure and order can help you feel more in control and less anxious.
- **Socialize.** Loneliness can worsen depression and make it harder to stay motivated². Reach out to your friends and family who support you and make you feel good. You can call them, text them, video chat with them, or meet them in person if it’s safe and possible. You can also join online communities or groups that share your interests or hobbies. Connecting with others who understand what you’re going through can help you feel less isolated and more hopeful.
- **Create a support network.** Sometimes, you may need more than just casual socializing to cope with your feelings. You may need professional help or guidance from someone who has been through what you’re experiencing. Don’t hesitate to seek help from a therapist, counselor, coach, mentor, or anyone else who can offer you emotional support and practical advice². You can also look for online resources or helplines that can provide you with information and assistance.
- **Focus on your breathing.** Focusing on your breathing may not sound like much, but it can make a world of difference if you’re feeling down³. When you breathe deeply, your brain sends a message to your body to calm down, which decreases your body’s overall stress response³. Spend a few minutes focusing on nothing except your breath. Inhale slowly through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. You can also try some breathing exercises or techniques that can help you relax and clear your mind.
- **Write down your goals.** If you have a few big goals that you’re working toward, writing them down can be a great way to help you stay motivated when you’re having a tough day⁴. To remind yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing, write down your goals on a sticky note or make a vision board with pictures and text⁴. Place them somewhere
